*ElasticSearch with Django

ElasticSearch indexes documents for your data instead of using data tables like a regular relational database does. This speeds up search, and offers a lot of other benefits that you don’t get with a regular database. I kept a regular relational database as well for storing user details, logins, and other data that ElasticSearch didn’t need to index.
